The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking. This can be described with a following recursive routine:

            1.  Given a current cell as a parameter,

            2.  Mark the current cell as visited

            3.  While the current cell has any unvisited neighbour cells:

                  4. Choose one of the unvisited neighbours

                  5. Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell

                  6. Invoke the routine recursively for the chosen cell

            7.  When the current cell has no unvisited neighbours, backtrack until it 

                finds a cell with unvisited neighbours, then repeat 4-6 until the entire

                grid has been visited
